    // For simplicity, since local, we can assume the migration is applied manually or use a different approach.
    // Wait, Supabase JS client with service_role can execute raw SQL via .from('pg_catalog.pg_class') but for ALTER, it's limited. The best is to use the Supabase management API or accept that in this environment, we need to skip DB change and add the field in code assuming it's there, but to follow plan, let's try to execute via a raw connection if possible.
